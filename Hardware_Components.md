### Raspberry Pi Sensor Monitoring Project - Hardware Components Report

**1. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB RAM)**
   - **Description**: A high-performance microcomputer with 8GB of RAM, featuring a quad-core CPU and support for dual-display output at up to 4K resolution. It offers multiple connectivity options, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and has a comprehensive GPIO pin setup for hardware interfacing.

**2. SD Card (32GB) with Linux-based OS**
   - **Description**: A digital storage medium used to store the operating system (OS) and project files. The 32GB capacity provides ample space for the Linux-based OS (such as Raspberry Pi OS), software libraries, and project data.

**3. Raspberry Pi Display v1.1 LCD**
   - **Description**: An official touchscreen display for the Raspberry Pi, featuring a 7-inch screen with 800x480 resolution. It connects via the DSI port, providing an interactive user interface for projects.

**4. 4-Channel 16-bit ADC (ADS1115)**
   - **Description**: An analog-to-digital converter module that offers 4 channels of 16-bit precision for reading analog signals. It's ideal for enhancing the Raspberry Pi's ability to interface with analog sensors, as the Pi itself does not have built-in analog input pins.

**5. Grove Modules (Electrical Parts for Control)**
   - **Description**: Modular electronic components from the Grove system, designed for easy plug-and-play interfacing with sensors and actuaries. These modules simplify the process of connecting complex sensors and devices to the Raspberry Pi without soldering.

**6. Pi Relay V2**
   - **Description**: A relay module designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi, capable of controlling high voltage/high current devices. It provides a safe and convenient way to integrate home appliances and industrial equipment into your project.

**7. RSA85 RS232 HAT by WAVESHARE**
   - **Description**: A HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) for the Raspberry Pi that provides RS232 communication capability. It's used to enable serial communication with devices that require RS232, such as some sensors, modems, or CNC machines.
