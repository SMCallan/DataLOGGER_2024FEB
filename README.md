To get your Raspberry Pi Sensor Monitoring Project configured correctly and set the sensors to the appropriate thresholds, follow these steps:

### Initial Setup & Configuration

1. **Raspberry Pi OS Setup**:
    - Install the Raspberry Pi OS on your SD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.
    - Connect your Raspberry Pi to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for the initial setup.
    - Power up your Raspberry Pi and complete the initial OS setup, including setting up Wi-Fi if necessary.

2. **Software Installation**:
    - Open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi and update the system with `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`.
    - Ensure Python 3 is installed by running `python3 --version`. Install pip if necessary with `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`.
    - Install the required libraries as mentioned in your project details:
        - Tkinter: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
        - Matplotlib: `pip3 install matplotlib`
        - Adafruit_ADS1x15: `pip3 install Adafruit-ADS1x15`
        - RPi.GPIO: `pip3 install RPi.GPIO` (usually pre-installed but update if necessary)

3. **Hardware Connections**:
    - Connect your sensors to the Raspberry Pi according to their requirements. For analog sensors, connect them to the ADS1115 module, and then connect the ADS1115 to the Raspberry Pi via I2C.
    - Connect any digital sensors directly to the appropriate GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.
    - Set up the Raspberry Pi Display by connecting it to the DSI port on the Raspberry Pi.
    - If using the Pi Relay V2 or the RS232 HAT, attach them to your Raspberry Pi following the manufacturer's instructions.

### Configuring Sensor Thresholds and Data Logging

1. **Modify `config.py`**:
    - Adjust the `sensor_mapping` section to reflect the sensors you have connected, including their types (analog/digital), channels, or GPIO pins.
    - Set `data_logging_interval` and `gui_update_interval` according to your project's needs.

2. **Adjust Alarm Thresholds**:
    - In `alarm_manager.py`, customize the threshold values for each sensor based on the environmental conditions you wish to monitor. For example, you might want to adjust the CO threshold based on the safety standards for the areas you are monitoring.

3. **Sensor Reading Adjustments**:
    - If necessary, calibrate your sensor readings in `sensor_manager.py` by adjusting the gain or applying calibration formulas to the sensor data to ensure accuracy.

4. **Testing**:
    - Before running your main application, test each sensor individually to ensure they are connected correctly and providing accurate readings.
    - Use simple test scripts to read data from each sensor and print the values to the console.

5. **Run the Application**:
    - Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and start the application with `python3 main.py`.
    - The GUI should launch, displaying real-time data from your sensors. Check the alarm functionality by simulating conditions that trigger the alarms.

6. **Customization and Expansion**:
    - As your project evolves, you may add more sensors or functionality. Update the `sensor_manager.py` to include new sensors and adjust the GUI in `gui_manager.py` as needed to accommodate additional data visualizations or controls.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Library Issues**: Make sure all required libraries are correctly installed. Attempt reinstallation if you encounter errors.
- **Hardware Connectivity**: Double-check all connections if sensors do not appear to be reporting data. Ensure I2C and GPIO configurations are correct.
- **Permission Errors**: Run your script with `sudo` if you encounter permission issues, especially when accessing GPIO pins.

This comprehensive setup and configuration guide aims to get your Raspberry Pi Sensor Monitoring Project up and running smoothly. Remember to consult the documentation for any specific libraries or hardware components you're using for additional details or troubleshooting steps.
